# VFCS

***This is an on-going project***
* created at: July 13, 2022*


## 1. Introduction
* What is VFCS?
  * Verified Flight Control System (VFCS) is an academic project for study the FCS software by theorem prover Coq.
  * We adopt the idea of construct-correct to analysis, modeling and design the FCS.
  * Coq proof assistant is a higher-order logic theorem prover based on Calculus of Inductive Constructions.
  * We mainly study the Multicopter at the first stage.
* Why start the project ?
  * FCS is a safety critical software system, and it's reliability is hard to promise by traditional Disign-Build-Test aproch.
  * The FCS is a comprehensive engineering system, and many special knowledge, experience data and mathematical theory need to be formal described , organized and verified. Meanwhile, these knowledge and theory are existed in many similiar system. 
  * So, it is a fundamental research topic with huge potential benefits
* Who are we?
  * We are a team focused on the study of formal engineering mathematics, located in Nanjing University of  Aeronautics and Astronautics in China.
